_Main articles: [Formation decisions](/Formation_decisions "Formation decisions")
, [Formable countries](/Formable_countries "Formable countries")
_  

Country formation decisions are kept on the pages of each formable country. All formable countries are listed below.

Forming a country through decision\[[edit](/index.php?title=Formable_countries&veaction=edit&section=T-1 "Edit section: Forming a country through decision")\

\]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Generally, a nation must meet the following requirements to form _most_ formables:

*   Target formable does _not_ exist
*   Current nation is not an [end-game tag](/Formable_countries#End-game_tags "Formable countries")
    
*   At peace
*   Is _not_ a non-tributary subject
*   Is _not_ a [Steppe Horde](/Steppe_Horde "Steppe Horde")
    
*   Own and core certain provinces (Some provinces can also be owned by non-tributary subjects)

And forming a country will have the following effects:

*   A new name and color; often some prestige, permanent claims and the _"Increased Centralization"_ modifier.
*   Most formable countries have unique [national ideas](/National_ideas "National ideas")
    . An event triggered by the formation decision gives a choice between switching ideas or keeping the existing set. Note that [custom nations](/Custom_nation "Custom nation")
     do not get the event this way.
*   Formation of a new country changes "historical rival" attitudes regarding other countries. For example, if Christian [![Flag of Ottomans](https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/images/thumb/8/89/Ottomans.png/20px-Ottomans.png)](/Ottomans "Ottomans")
     [Ottomans](/Ottomans "Ottomans")
     form [![Flag of Roman Empire](https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/images/thumb/4/4e/Roman_Empire.png/20px-Roman_Empire.png)](/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire")
     [Roman Empire](/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire")
    , they will no longer be historical rivals with [![Flag of Austria](https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/images/thumb/7/7f/Austria.png/20px-Austria.png)](/Austria "Austria")
     [Austria](/Austria "Austria")
    . This also applies inversely; if [![Flag of Burgundy](https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/images/thumb/b/b0/Burgundy.png/20px-Burgundy.png)](/Burgundy "Burgundy")
     [Burgundy](/Burgundy "Burgundy")
     form [![Flag of France](https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/images/thumb/d/de/France.png/20px-France.png)](/France "France")
     [France](/France "France")
    , they will become historical rivals with [![Flag of Austria](https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/images/thumb/7/7f/Austria.png/20px-Austria.png)](/Austria "Austria")
     [Austria](/Austria "Austria")
    .
*   Forming another nation while being the [![Emperor of china icon.png](https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/images/thumb/2/25/Emperor_of_china_icon.png/28px-Emperor_of_china_icon.png)](/Emperor_of_China "Emperor of China")
     Emperor of China resets all reforms made as the previous nation. This is important to keep in mind if looking to form [![Flag of Qing](https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/images/thumb/9/95/Qing.png/20px-Qing.png)](/Qing "Qing")
     [Qing](/Qing "Qing")
     or [![Flag of Yuan](https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/images/thumb/a/a8/Yuan.png/20px-Yuan.png)](/Yuan "Yuan")
     [Yuan](/Yuan "Yuan")
    .
*   Forming a country may require your [capital](/Capital "Capital")
     to be in a region, or it may move your capital. This may void your [trade company investments](/Trade_company#Trade_company_investments "Trade company")
    , and if you don't have a [main trade port](/Province#Main_trading_port "Province")
     it may move your home node.
*   Forming a country resets any expanded infrastructure done in any provinces. Centralized states remain centralized however.
*   All separatism in provinces owned at the time of formation is removed as soon as they are cores - instantly if they already are cores. This is very useful to get rid of rebels when expanding rapidly.

_While the technology is still in its infancy, firearms can be a deadly force on any battlefield. In order to be efficient, however, firearms require regular training and a steady supply of ammunition. For a regular levy army this level of proficiency can be hard to maintain. A soldier that has to go home to tend his fields is not one that will regularly exercise with his weapon.  
While we cannot change our entire army structure in one stroke we can ensure that a core of highly trained salaried troops specialize in these weapons._

_To the extent that uniforms are in use in our armies regiment commanders are often expected to provide and pay for them. This leads to a great variety in colors and styles on the battlefield and makes identifying friend from foe confusing.

_The gods are everywhere. They are the air we breathe; the earth we walk on. They are the axe we swing; the water we flow with._ In a polytheistic religion such as ours, the choice to devote oneself to only one of the many splendid gods is not easily taken, and most often one will reconsider their choice as their life progresses in unthought ways. Fortunately, our priests commune with gods, and allow our \[Root.Monarch.GetTitle\] to change their personal deity.

### ![Execute decision.png](https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/images/6/6d/Execute_decision.png)Proclaim Protection for the Protestants

_The Protestants of the Holy Roman Empire are victims of inquisitions, open hostility and discrimination by the Imperial Crown itself. But they lack the courage and the strength to call to arms and defend themselves against the injustice done to them._

It is time for us to side with the Reformation, and proclam officially that we will support and protect the Protestants of the Holy Roman Empire.

_Before its devastation by the Magyar hordes, Veligrad had been the greatest city in all of central Europe. From here, Constantine and Methodius worked on their apostolic missions, and Rostislav and Svatopluk ruled the vast realm with an iron fist. We have now restored the city to its long-gone glory, and many are suggesting that in order to further strengthen our legitimacy, we make Veligrad our capital once again._

### ![Execute decision.png](https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/images/6/6d/Execute_decision.png)Release Prussia

_Our ties with the region of Prussia trace back to the reign of Premysl Otakar II, a time when the Bohemian crown held significant influence over the territories of the Holy Roman Empire. As we have now regained control over these lands, it has been suggested that we establish a Prussian Duchy. Doing so would not only ease our administrative burden, but the Duchy would also serve as a buffer against the Baltic incursions._

### ![Execute decision.png](https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/images/6/6d/Execute_decision.png)Transfer the Ownership of Nitra

_The Principality of Nitra fell under the Hungarian rule in the aftermath of Great Moravia's disintegration, and although it kept its autonomous status for some time, the ducal rights of Nitra were abolished by King Coloman. Since then, Nitra and Slovaks had no special position in Hungary whatsoever. As we now rule Hungary, it is time we reorganize our lands and make the Principality of Nitra united with our crown once again._
